## React Popper

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-popper.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-popper)
[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/souporserious/react-popper.svg)](https://david-dm.org/souporserious/react-popper)

React wrapper around [Popper.js](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/).

## Install

```bash
yarn add react-popper # or npm install -P react-popper
```

Or if you are using `<script>`:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-popper/dist/react-popper.js"></script>
<!-- UMD library exposed as `window.ReactPopper` -->
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { Manager, Target, Popper, Arrow } from 'react-popper'

const PopperExample = () => (
  <Manager>
    <Target style={{ width: 120, height: 120, background: '#b4da55' }}>
      Target Box
    </Target>
    <Popper placement="left" className="popper">
      Left Content
      <Arrow className="popper__arrow"/>
    </Popper>
    <Popper placement="right" className="popper">
      Right Content
      <Arrow className="popper__arrow"/>
    </Popper>
  </Manager>
)
```

**Heads up!**: `<Manager />`, by default, is not going to render any wrapper element in React 16.  
This is an useful feature of React, that reduces the amount of markup generated by this component.

If you use React 15 or lower, remember to set its `tag` attribute to a valid HTML tag name:

```jsx
<Manager tag="div">
```

## Usage w/ child function

This is a useful way to interact with custom components. Just make sure you pass down the refs properly.

```jsx
import { Manager, Target, Popper, Arrow } from 'react-popper'

const PopperExample = () => (
  <Manager>
    <Target>
      {({ targetProps }) => (
        <div {...targetProps}>
          Target Box
        </div>
      )}
    </Target>
    <Popper placement="left">
      {({ popperProps, restProps }) => (
        <div
          className="popper"
          {...popperProps}
        >
          Popper Content
          <Arrow>
            {({ arrowProps, restProps }) => (
              <span
                className="popper__arrow"
                {...arrowProps}
              />
            )}
          </Arrow>
        </div>
      )}
    </Popper>
  </Manager>
)
```

## `Shared Props`

`Target`, `Popper`, and `Arrow` all share the following props

#### `component`: PropTypes.oneOfType([PropTypes.node, PropTypes.func])

A valid DOM tag or custom component to render. If using a custom component, an `innerRef` prop will be passed down that **must** be attached to the child component ref.

#### `innerRef`: PropTypes.func

Use this prop to access the internal ref. Does not apply to the `Manager` component since we do not interact with its ref.

## `Manager`

This is a special component that provides the `Target` component to the `Popper` component.  
It's used just to wire together `Target` and `Popper` components, but it will not render any HTML markup, the only rendered components will be its children.

#### `tag`: PropTypes.oneOfType([PropTypes.string, PropTypes.bool])

If you are using React 15 or lower, React doesn't support fragment renderer components, this means that you will have to define its `tag` property to make the component render a wrapper HTML element.

For instance, the following example will render 3 HTML elements instead of the 2 that would have been rendered with React 16 without the `tag` property set to `div`:

```jsx
<Manager tag="div">
  <Target />
  <Popper />
</Manager>
```

## `Target`

This is just a simple component that subscribes to `Manager`, so `Popper` can make use of it. Pass any props as you normally would here.

Each `Target` must be wrapped in a `Manager`, and each `Manager` can wrap only one `Target`.

#### `children`: PropTypes.oneOfType([PropTypes.node, PropTypes.func])

A `Target`'s child may be one of the following:

- a React element[s]
- a function accepting the following object (all props must be passed down in order for Popper.js to work properly)

  ```js
  {
    targetProps: {
      ref // a function that accepts the target component as an argument
    },
    restProps // any other props that came through the Target component
  }
  ```


## `Popper`

Your popper that gets attached to the `Target` component.

Each `Popper` must be wrapped in a `Manager`, and each `Manager` can wrap multiple `Popper` components.

#### `placement`: PropTypes.oneOf(Popper.placements)
#### `eventsEnabled`: PropTypes.bool
#### `modifiers`: PropTypes.object

Passes respective options to a new [Popper instance](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/blob/master/docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md#new-popperreference-popper-options).  
As for `onCreate` and `onUpdate`, these callbacks were intentionally left out in favor of using the [component lifecycle methods](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html#the-component-lifecycle). If you have a good use case for these please feel free to file and issue and I will consider adding them in.

#### `children`: PropTypes.oneOfType([PropTypes.node, PropTypes.func])

A `Popper`'s child may be one of the following:

- a React element[s]
- a function accepting the following object (all props must be passed down in order for the PopperJS to work properly)

  ```js
  {
    popperProps: {
      ref, // a function that accepts the popper component as an argument
      style, // the styles to apply to the popper element
      ['data-placement'] // the placement of the Popper
    },
    restProps // any other props that came through the Popper component
  }
  ```

## `Arrow`

Another component that subscribes to the `Popper` component as an [arrow modifier](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/blob/master/docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md#modifiers..arrow). Must be a child of `Popper`.

#### `children`: PropTypes.oneOfType([PropTypes.node, PropTypes.func])

An `Arrow`'s child may be one of the following:

- a React element[s]
- a function accepting the following object (all props must be passed down in order for the PopperJS to work properly)

  ```js
  {
    arrowProps: {
      ref, // a function that accepts the arrow component as an argument
      style // the styles to apply to the arrow element
    },
    restProps // any other props that came through the Arrow component
  }
  ```
